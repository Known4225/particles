# Particles

There are three rules:
- Particles move at the same speed and direction unless acted upon (screen wraps - torus geometry)
- When red particles hit each other, or when grey particles hit each other, they combine into a larger particle
- When red particles hit grey particles, they split up into many individual red particles

Also you can create a particle by holding down click and dragging towards where you want it to go

# To Do
- Particle collision algorithm
- User spawned particles
